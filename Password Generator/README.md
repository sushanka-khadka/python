# Password Generator

This Python script generates a random password based on user preferences. There are two methods available: the first generates a password of a specified length with mixed characters, and the second allows you to customize the number of symbols, lower case letters, upper case letters, and numbers.

## Features

- Random password generation
- Support for upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and symbols
- Two password generation methods:
  1. Fixed length with a mix of all characters
  2. Customizable number of character types

## How to Run the Script

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
## Method 1: Fixed-Length Password
The program will ask you to input the desired password length, then it will generate a password using a random mix of lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and symbols.

### Example  
    Password Generator
    How many characters do you want in your password? 12
    Your password is B9,a&kP*j13_

### How It Works:
* The user specifies the total number of characters (pass_len).
* A password is generated by selecting random characters from lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and symbols.
* The password is displayed to the user.

## Method 2: Custom Number of Character Types
This method allows you to specify exactly how many lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and symbols you want in the password.

### Example:
    How many symbols do you want? 3
    How many lower case do you want? 4
    How many upper case do you want? 3
    How many numbers do you want? 2
    Your password is: ['B', 'D', 'C', 'm', 'f', 'h', 'q', '4', '9', '!', '@', '#']

The list is shuffled, and then the password is output as a string.

### How It Works:
1. The user inputs the number of symbols, lower case letters, upper case letters, and numbers they want in the password.
2. The script generates the specified number of each character type using random.choices().
3. The generated characters are combined and shuffled to ensure a random order.
4. The shuffled list of characters is then converted into a string and displayed as the final password.

### Sample Output After Shuffle:
    Your password is: q9fh#B4@Cm!
## Key Functions Used
  * `random.choice()`: Used to select a single random character from a sequence.
  * `random.choices()`: Used to select multiple random characters from a sequence.
  * `random.shuffle()`: Shuffles a list in place to ensure the password has a random order.
