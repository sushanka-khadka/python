2. There are no jokers.
3. The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10
4. The the Ace can count as 11 or 1 as per condition
  if the score is already above 21 then it will be 1
  else it will be 11
5. Use the following list as the deck of cards:
  cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
6. The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
7. Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.

  checks for score 

computer can play when user has no intenion to draw new card
computer can play till not haviing black jack and score is below 17
