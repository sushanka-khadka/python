Understanding is vs == in Python
This Python script explores the differences between the is and == operators, demonstrating how they behave with various data types and comparisons.

Features
Comparison of Boolean Values:

The script checks how True and False relate to integers and strings using both == and is:
python
Copy code
print(True == 1)          # True
print(True == '1')        # False
print(True == ' ')        # False
print(True == True)       # True
Identity vs Equality:

It compares objects using is to check identity (whether they are the same object in memory) versus ==, which checks for equality in value:
python
Copy code
print('True is True ', True is True)     # True
print('True == True ', True == True)     # True
print('True is False ', True is False)   # False
Comparisons with Different Data Types:

The script compares various data types, including integers, strings, lists, and tuples:
python
Copy code
print(1 == 1.0)            # True
print(' ' == '\0')        # False
print([] == ())           # False
print('1' == 1)           # False
print((1, 2, 3) == [1, 2, 3])  # False
print((1, 2, 3) == (1, 2, 3))  # True
print([1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3])  # True
print([1, 2, 3] == (1, 2, 3))  # False
Identity Comparisons with Lists:

The script highlights how lists are compared for identity:
python
Copy code
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
print('a is b ', a is b)   # False (different locations in memory)
print('a == b ', a == b)   # True (same values)
print('a is a ', a is a)   # True (same object)
Conclusion:

The script provides insight into the nuances of using is versus ==, especially when dealing with mutable and immutable data types.
Usage
