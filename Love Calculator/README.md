 
# Love Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates a "love score" based on the names of two individuals. It counts specific letters from the words "true" and "love" in the combined names and computes a score.

## How the Program Works

1. The user inputs their name and their partner's name.
2. The names are combined and converted to lowercase.
3. The program counts how many times the letters `t`, `r`, `u`, and `e` appear in the combined names (for "true").
4. It then counts how many times the letters `l`, `o`, `v`, and `e` appear (for "love").
5. The score is generated by combining the count of the letters from "true" and "love".
6. Based on the score, a message is displayed:
   - If the score is less than 10 or greater than 90, the message will be: "You go together like coke and mentos".
   - If the score is between 40 and 50, the message will be: "You are alright together".
   - Otherwise, it will just display the score.

## Example
    name_1 = 'Anil'
    name_2 = 'Jack'
    
    # Combined name = 'aniljack'
    # Count of 't', 'r', 'u', 'e' = 0
    # Count of 'l', 'o', 'v', 'e' = 2
    # Love score = '02'
    
    # Output: "Your love score is 02%"

## How to Run the Program
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter:
   ```bash
   python love_calculator.py
3. Enter the two names when prompted, and the program will output your love score.
